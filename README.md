- ⚙️ I use daily: `.java`, `.js`, `.go`, `.sh`, `SQL`, `Docker`, `Linux`, `Kubernetes`, `AWS`
- 🗓️ I use occasionally: `.py`, `Jenkins`, `MongoDB`, `Kafka`
- 🧠 I enjoy brainstorming solutions and tackling complex problems in tech, life, and the things I care about.
- 🌍 I love open-source and frequently hunt for products and projects to contribute to.
- 📝 I also (though not as often as I'd like) share my experiences and learnings on my [medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-black?logo=medium&logoColor=white) blog.
- 💬 `ping` me about **software engineering**, **devops**, **AI**, and **startups**.
